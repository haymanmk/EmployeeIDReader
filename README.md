# Prerequirements
This app is built with Html, CSS, JavaScript, and other tools, such as EJS, Express, Axios, and Node.js.

## Install Node.js
As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. To create a server on local device, Node.js is supposed to [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install firstly.
> Node.js can help your program to access resources of local device with ease, such as read files in your device and access interfaces the device has.

## npm
npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages. After installing Node.js, npm is also installed alongside it. Packages shared from worldwide developers can be search on [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/), and then type in `npm install "packageName`" in  terminal to download and install this package in your project.

## Initialize packages management
To well manage the packages used in project, npm can handle it well. Type `npm init` to initialize it as a package managing tool.

## Install Express
Open a terminal and change directory to the project folder, type `npm install express` which will install it and create a dependency between project and express package.

## Install Axios
We have used Express to build a server side application, next step is to create a client side program which is responsible for post data to web API or get data from web API. Axios is a simple [promise based](https://www.casper.tw/development/2020/02/16/all-new-promise/) HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Simply type `npm install axios` to install it.

## Install EJS
[EJS](https://ejs.co/) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. I use EJS to create a JavaScript-based HTML tamplate which lets you update different data or information to this HTML template without having to built a new HTML page for different request. In the same way, simply type `npm install ejs` to install it.

# How to run this app
Type `node app.js` in terminal to activate a server in the local device, and then open a browser, visit local server by typing http://localhost:5000/ in the address bar.
